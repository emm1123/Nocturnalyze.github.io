# Welcome to Nocturnalyze Research Website

## About Us
We are a Senior Project team at the University of New Hampshire in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department. Our project is focuing on the biomedical aspects of ECE, as well as incorporating some interests such as therapuetics. 

## Research Focus
__Sleep Disturbances__
Investigation of sleep disruptions in college students and their impact on mental health, academic performance, and overall well-being. 
  
__Non-Invasive Technology__
Development of a real-time, low cost sleep monitoring system using off-the-shelf components and advanced sensing techniques. 
  
__Therapeutic Aspects__
Implementation of Adaptive interventions to improve sleep quality and mitigate symptoms linked to sleep disturbances. 
  
__Environmental Sensing__
Utilization of temperature and sound monitoring to assess external factors contributing to sleep disturbances.

## Current Projects
__Non-Invasive Sleep Monitoring and Therapeutic System__

__Focus:__ Developing a non-invasive sensor system integrating a bed pad and control box to monitor sleep disturbances through sound, pressure, and temperature sensing. The system responds by playing therapeutic noises and light to improve sleep quality.
